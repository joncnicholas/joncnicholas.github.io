  <p>The Lake District in the UK is 885 square miles of fantastic mountaineering, climbing and scrambling terrain. Over the bank holiday weekend (23-24/05/2015), there was a day that made me feel as though I was walking in the countryside in Italy and weather to match 20-25 degree heat, nil wind, not a single cloud in the sky and visibility clear for 100 miles.</p>

<p>The walk up to Langstrath Valley bending up to the right:</p>

<p>I have been regularly going climbing and mountaineering every quarter for about the last 3-4 years since university. On this fine day, a friend of mine and I did a quality mountain day with a wild camp at the base of a tarn. The route would take up to about 800metres and covered about 25miles in total. Our route for the 2 days looked like the below:</p>

<p><strong>23/05</strong> – Seathwaite Park to Stonethwaite via thoreythwaite farm to Langstrath Valley to Langdale Combe to Angle Tarn to Sprinkling Tarn via Tongue head and Esk Hause.</p>

<p><strong>24/05</strong> – Sprinkling Tarn to Styhead Tarn to Styhead Ghyll via Taylor Force to Seathwaite farm.</p>

<p>We set off from Seathwaite a little car park next to a farm at approximately 11am, no alpine start, but with nightfall not till approximately 2200 and not a bad piece of weather predicted in sight we had 10 hours to get to our spot for the night.</p>

<p>Langstrath Valley from behind climbing into Langdale Combe:</p>

        <p class="image-caption">Langstrath Valley</p>
    
</div>

<p>Langstrath, stunning in weather like this and fairly flat is also remote and harsh in worse conditions and not a place to get caught out on here, as mountain rescue will have to helicopter you out if things go wrong.</p>

<p>At the top of this climb, this brought us to approximately 800m and the view is now one of my favourties from the trip:</p>

        <p class="image-caption">Top of Langdale Combe</p>
    
</div>

<p>On the summit of this climb, took us to Langdale Combe, a boggy nightmare of a place, which we had to contour round the mountain to avoid taking the wrong path to Angle Tarn. The alternate path would of taken us to Scafell Pike (the highest mountain in the UK), which on a beautiful bank holiday weekend like this would be heaving with Geordies and Scousers, ignorant to the conditions and many dangers an exposed ridge can have. Of which we heard many rescue helicopters later on in the evening, which we discovered the next day were evacuating people off for heat stroke and exhaustion.</p>

<p>Our penultimate waypoint before setting up camp and a happy sight after trudging through a number of miles of boggy terrain we left Angle Tarn behind with a spectacular view behind:</p>

        <p class="image-caption">Angle Tarn and Surrounds</p>
    
</div>

<p>With the aim in sight, we arrived at Sprinkling Tarn after 7 hours, backs and legs weary. We pitched our tent and prepared some boil in the bag food which was briskly followed by in sleeping bag by about 2100. How boring are we?! Ask that question when you are getting up at 0430am.</p>

<p>Sprinkling tarn at 1830GMT:</p>

<p>As is the way of the world, the 23/05 was spectacular. By midnight, there were storm force winds and constant rain for the next 7 hours, so you can imagine the how much sleep we got as you can tell by my face the next morning and the weather we left behind and walked through at 0430:</p>

<p>Anyway, a cracking 2 days, that I still felt in my legs 2 days later. A very memorable long weekend.</p>
