A clear weekend in the UK is a rare event, the weekend in the middle of April 2017 saw high cloud bases (circa 4500ft), relative high pressure and great visibility. On Saturday, I flew to Compton Abbas and on Sunday I flew to Leicester.

I filmed the route out to Compton (however, a rookie error surfaced and the camera died on the return):

Stapleford (EGSG) -> Tunbridge Wells -> Seaford VOR -> GoodWood/Chichester VOR -> Bishops Waltham -> Southampton Overhead -> Romsey -> Compton Abbas (EGHA)

We returned via the Southampton-Bournemouth airspace gap to Cowes, along the south coast and northward to Stapleford.

Happy watching!
