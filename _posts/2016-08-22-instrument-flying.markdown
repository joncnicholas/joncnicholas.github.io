Since tipping over the 100-hour mark and after encountering awful return conditions on from the Isle of Wight, I thought it would be a good idea to do a rating which would give me the ability to get me out of worsening conditions with confidence.

With a possible strive for a CPL/IR in the future I thought the Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) would be a good starting point, especially toward earning a competency based IR. Least of all, it would give me valuable skills to confidently navigate variable weather conditions.

After completing the first couple of hours on basic instrument flying going well, my third lesson was on NDB tracking, intercepting and ILS tracking. This was a lesson that made my brain melt! So after this sortie, I thought I’d try and recap what I did by drawing together my thoughts on paper – which are the 2 diagrams below.

When my instructor attempted to explain NDB material on the ground we finished the brief in an hour. Three hours later we finish after each one of us becoming confused using practical examples to attempt to solidify understanding! Therefore, I’m not intending on trying to verbally describe it here. Instead, I thought I’d try and draw it in 2 pictures (tracking to and tracking away from) and pray and hope I haven’t confused myself in drawing them up!

Next is applying these principles to a full NDB hold with wind (diagrams above take no wind into account), which is my next lesson in the air in a new aircraft to me - the PA28R-200 or Arrow. So on top of my brain melting I’m handling a lovely 200hp 120kt aircraft …. How hard can it be?
