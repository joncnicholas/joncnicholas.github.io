Some memorable parts of a flight I took with a friend to Shoreham (from Stapleford) on the day of the Eastbourne Airshow in August 2015.

A tally-ho moment (just wish i had the RAF tash to back it up):

Waiting to take off at Shoreham at hold point K1 when I get the following radio message from Shoreham Tower:



	
  * "GSACO (me), holding at Kilo 1 for the run and break spitfire"


and quickly followed by the sound of a Merlin V12 roaring past overhead (keep your eyes peeled at about 2mins 20 seconds). This was aptly followed by another call from Shoreham Tower saying:

	
  * "GCO, Line up and wait after the landing spitfire"


Best repeat ive ever had to say!

Enjoy!
