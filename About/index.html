<p>After 5 years in the IT security industry, conducting fascinating projects and fun research like:</p>

</ul>
I decided to pursue a different line of work that I believe will keep me happier into later life.

I have been fortunate enough to have some incredible experiences. It has led me to realise two things I cherish: a passion for aviation which has led me to pursue an aviation career and a love of the outdoors.<br>
So you ask what are these experiences? Here are two of my favourites and most nostalgic:<br><br>

<p align="left"><strong>Flying through the Welsh valleys at 500ft at 420kts in a RAF Hawk T1a:</strong>

<p>I am the guy who –</p>
<ul>
<li>Likes to walk up mountains come rain, snow, wind or shine.</li>
<li>Will give you facts about the plane you are flying on.</li>
<li>Is more excited about the flight than the holiday at the end of it.</li>
<li>Always stops and looks if a plane is flying past.</li>
<li>Tinkers and breaks tech.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary: &#8211;</strong> I&#8217;m an aviation and technology geek with a passion for the outdoors.</p>
